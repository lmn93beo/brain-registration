    "You've written a lot of code in this assignment to provide a whole host of neural network functionality. Dropout, Batch Norm, and 2D convolutions are some of the workhorses of deep learning in computer vision. You've also worked hard to make your code efficient and vectorized.\n",

    "* Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. Writing your own modules to run on GPUs is beyond the scope of this class, unfortunately.\n",

In this section we will start by building a model with basic TensorFlow constructs to help you better understand what's going on under the hood of the higher-level APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is primarily a framework for working with **static computational graphs**. Nodes in the computational graph are Tensors which will hold n-dimensional arrays when the graph is run; edges in the graph represent functions that will operate on Tensors when the graph is run to actually perform useful computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a typical TensorFlow program is written in two distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a computational graph that describes the computation that you want to perform. This stage doesn't actually perform any computation; it just builds up a symbolic representation of your computation. This stage will typically define one or more `placeholder` objects that represent inputs to the computational graph.\n",
    "2. Run the computational graph many times. Each time the graph is run you will specify which parts of the graph you want to compute, and pass a `feed_dict` dictionary that will give concrete values to any `placeholder`s in the graph.\n",

    "This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `H x W x C` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the value of N from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be H x W x C, but we don't need to specify that explicitly). \n",

    "Note that the step of updating the weights is itself an operation in the computational graph - the calls to `tf.assign_sub` in `training_step` return TensorFlow operations that mutate the weights when they are executed. There is an important bit of subtlety here - when we call `sess.run`, TensorFlow does not execute all operations in the computational graph; it only executes the minimal subset of the graph necessary to compute the outputs that we ask TensorFlow to produce. As a result, naively computing the loss would not cause the weight update operations to execute, since the operations needed to compute the loss do not depend on the output of the weight update. To fix this problem, we insert a **control dependency** into the graph, adding a duplicate `loss` node to the graph that does depend on the outputs of the weight update operations; this is the object that we actually return from the `training_step` function. As a result, asking TensorFlow to evaluate the value of the `loss` returned from `training_step` will also implicitly update the weights of the network using that minibatch of data.\n",

    "# Part III: Keras Model API\n",
    "Implementing a neural network using the low-level TensorFlow API is a good way to understand how TensorFlow works, but it's a little inconvenient - we had to manually keep track of all Tensors holding learnable parameters, and we had to use a control dependency to implement the gradient descent update step. This was fine for a small network, but could quickly become unweildy for a large complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately TensorFlow provides higher-level packages such as `tf.keras` and `tf.layers` which make it easy to build models out of modular, object-oriented layers; `tf.train` allows you to easily train these models using a variety of different optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the notebook we will define neural network models using the `tf.keras.Model` API. To implement your own model, you need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a new class which subclasses `tf.keras.model`. Give your class an intuitive name that describes it, like `TwoLayerFC` or `ThreeLayerConvNet`.\n",
    "2. In the initializer `__init__()` for your new class, define all the layers you need as class attributes. The `tf.layers` package provides many common neural-network layers, like `tf.layers.Dense` for fully-connected layers and `tf.layers.Conv2D` for convolutional layers. Under the hood, these layers will construct `Variable` Tensors for any learnable parameters. **Warning**: Don't forget to call `super().__init__()` as the first line in your initializer!\n",
    "3. Implement the `call()` method for your class; this implements the forward pass of your model, and defines the *connectivity* of your network. Layers defined in `__init__()` implement `__call__()` so they can be used as function objects that transform input Tensors into output Tensors. Don't define any new layers in `call()`; any layers you want to use in the forward pass should be defined in `__init__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you define your `tf.keras.Model` subclass, you can instantiate it and use it like the model functions from Part II.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module API: Two-Layer Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a concrete example of using the `tf.keras.Model` API to define a two-layer network. There are a few new bits of API to be aware of here:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an `Initializer` object to set up the initial values of the learnable parameters of the layers; in particular `tf.variance_scaling_initializer` gives behavior similar to the Kaiming initialization method we used in Part II. You can read more about it here: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/variance_scaling_initializer\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct `tf.layers.Dense` objects to represent the two fully-connected layers of the model. In addition to multiplying their input by a weight matrix and adding a bias vector, these layer can also apply a nonlinearity for you. For the first layer we specify a ReLU activation function by passing `activation=tf.nn.relu` to the constructor; the second layer does not apply any activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately the `flatten` function we defined in Part II is not compatible with the `tf.keras.Model` API; fortunately we can use `tf.layers.flatten` to perform the same operation. The issue with our `flatten` function from Part II has to do with static vs dynamic shapes for Tensors, which is beyond the scope of this notebook; you can read more about the distinction [in the documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/faq#tensor_shapes)."

    "However for many models you don't need such flexibility - a lot of models can be expressed as a sequential stack of layers, with the output of each layer fed to the next layer as input. If your model fits this pattern, then there is an even easier way to define your model: using `tf.keras.Sequential`. You don't need to write any custom classes; you simply call the `tf.keras.Sequential` constructor with a list containing a sequence of layer objects.\n",

You can use the `check_accuracy` and `train` functions from above, or you can implement your own training loop.\n",

    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5 and 3x3; is this optimal?\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 16 and 32 filters. Would more or fewer do better?\n",

    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going above and beyond\n",
    "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
    "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
